    "description": "What do you do when your everyday delay repeats just aren't stimulating enough? The Harmony Delay may just hold the answer! This model allows you to select the Key for your performance via the TWEAK knob (choose any Key, from A to G#) and apply one of the eight Pitch Modes via the TWEEZ knob for endless arpeggiated entertainment. Each Pitch Mode provides an intelligently pitch-shifted triad pattern, creating a cascade of harmonic repeats that accompany your plucked notes. Use the TIME to set the rate of the cycling repeats, and the MIX to blend the delay signal with your input. TWEAK selects the Key, chromatically, from A to G#. TWEEZ selects between the eight Pitch Modes, which consist of the following pitched intervals: 1) 1, 3, and 5 major 2) 1, 3, and 5 minor 3) 1, 2, and 3 major 4) 1, 2, and 3 minor 5) 1, -8, and +8 octaves 6) 1, 5, and 8 major 7) 1, -3, and +3 major 8) 1, -3, and +3 minor *See \"U.S. Registered Trademarks\" on page 42 .
